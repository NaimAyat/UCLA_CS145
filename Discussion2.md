# Discussion 2
# What are the linear classifiers in machine learning?
1. Linear Regression
1. Support Vector Machine (linear Kernel)
1. Perceptron with linear activation function
1. Naive Bayes Model based on its constraints
1. Linear Discriminant Analysis (Fisherâ€™s Discriminant Analysis)
1. Logistic Regression (only when we are using this model for maximum likelihood estimation)
