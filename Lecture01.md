# Lecture 1
## What is Data Mining?
* "Knowledge discovery from data" (KDD)
  * Knowledge discovery process
    1. Data cleaning
    2. Data warehouse
    3. Task-relevant data
    4. Data mining
    5. Pattern evaluation
## What Kinds of Data Can Be Mined?
* Vector Data
* Set Data
* Text Data
* Sequence Data
* Time Series
* Graph / Network
* Image Data
## Data Mining Function: Association and Correlation Analysis
* Frequent patterns (or frequent itemsets)
  * What items are frequently purchased together in your Amazon transactions?
* Association, correlation vs. causality
  * A typical association rule
    * `Diaper -> Beer [0.5%, 75%] (support, confidence)`
## Data Mining Function: Classification
* Classification and label prediction
  * Construct models (functions) based on some training examples
  * Describe and distinguish classes or concepts for future prediction
    * E.g., classify countries based on (climate), or classify cars based on (gas mileage)
  * Predict some unknown class labels
* Typical methods
  * Decision trees, na√Øve Bayesian classification, support vector machines, neural networks, rule-based classification, pattern-base classification, logistic regression
* Typical applications
  * Credit card fraud detection, direct marketing, classifying stars, diseases, web-pages
## Data Mining Function: Cluster Analysis
* Unsupervised learning (i.e., Class label is unknown)
* Group data to form new categories (i.e., clusters), e.g., cluster houses to find distribution patterns
* Principle: Maximizing intra-class similarity & minimizing interclass similarity
* Many methods and applications
