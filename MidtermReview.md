# Classification
## Logistic Regression
* Predicts whether something is true or false, not continuous data
* "S" curve goes from 0 to 1
* Maximum likelihood: calculate the likelihood of observing each data point
## [Decision Trees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKD5gxPPeY0)
* [Calculate entropy, choose the one with the highest entropy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmCV4g7_-QM)
* [Information gain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nodQ2s0CUbI)
## [KNN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqYde-LULfs)
* Given N training vectors, identify the k nearest neighbors of c
## [SVM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NxnPkZM9bc)
* Goal: design a hyperplane that classifies all training vectors into two classes (linearly separate)
* Best choice is the hyperplane that leaves the maximum margin between both classes
